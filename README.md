# MobileComputingMentalAwareness
This is a mobile app for Android that will help inform people about depression as well as ways to help/get help.
Authors: Chandler Wright, Caleb Gilmore, Yemi Runsewe

Objective: Many people these days suffer from mental health issues. To keep it doable, we will focus mostly on depression and suicide prevention. Not so much for the person in question, but rather for those around them. We hope to make an app that allows others to recognize the signs of depression/suicide. 

Activities: We can have slides that have the general signs, and advice. This advice can range from “should the person be reported to someone who can help them” or “here is a list of resources that you can direct the person towards.” These resources can be either online, in person counselors, or any other professional who is qualified. 
* Depression Awareness (for those without depression): Give a list of possible symptoms and ways to help/support those with depression.
* Coping methods (for those with depression): A list of commonly used, positive, coping methods for helping get through short bursts of depression
* Map of surrounding therapists offices: Using location data or user input for a zip code it will show a list of available depression/mental help therapy locations
    * This will use the Google Maps API that is built into Google Play services for Android
* Destress game: A short game to help destress
    * The game is to try to pop as many bubbles as possible on screen to get a numerical score. There will not be a high score (cannot see previous best). The max amount of bubbles that can be on screen at once will be 4. When popped they will move locations before reappearing.
* Chat feature : A community where people can talk with others 
    * CometChat
    * Chatkit for Android
    * pre-register userID - superhero2, superhero3
    * no password required
    * note: when using the same divice or emulator before one can login in another user you must click logout
    
   APIs:
   * CometChat
   * Chatkit for Android
   * Google Play services for Android
